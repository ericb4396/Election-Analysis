# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview 
A Colorado Board of ELections employee named Tom assigned us the task of completing an election audit on a local congressional election. He gave us 5 tasks to complete.

1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software used: Python 3.8.5 and Visual Code Studio 1.55.0

## Summary
The analysis of the election showed that:
- There were 369,711 total votes in this congressional district.
- There were three candidates named:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The results of the election were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes or 23.0% of the votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes or 3.1% of the votes.
- With these results we can show that the winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette receiving 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the votes.

## Challenge Overview
In the challenge, we were tasked with finding out which county had the highest voter turnout in the congressional district during this election.
## Challenge Summary
- This challenge showed that there was 3 counties within this congressional district.
- The three counties were
    - Jefferson
    - Denver
    - Arapahoe
- There were a total of 369,711 votes and the breakdown by county was:
    - Jefferson had 38,855 votes or 10.5% of the total votes.
    - Denver had 306,055 votes or 82.8% of the total votes.
    - Arapahoe had 24,801 votes or 6.7% of the total votes.
- With this information, the county with the most turn out was Denver.
- With this scriptI believe you could modify it to go out to the state level and see what states were more impactuful in a national election. Also, you could modify it down and make it simpler to be used for a school election by changing the counties into grade level and then have mulitple candidate races with repeated code just changinng the numbers and the names.
